The code for the website that a user would login to.

I was unable to get a sso working. 

see previous assignment for extra details

I just don't get where the SSO is supposed to be implemented?

I go to websites like AuthO and make an account or whatever, then make a project, but out of all the pre built options or whatever I can't find what I need to run on the server I have. I'm not sure how else I could configure a server atm?

When I go to a website like the ones I went to for a previous assignment, it's like they are doing something different from what I'm doing.
I'm not sure if this sso is supposed to be some program I'm supposed to write or just some thing I install to the server. I've installed
a bunch of stuff on my server, at least I think I have. If I were to write the program myself I'm not sure where I'd even start. 

When I'm messing around while ssh'd into my server I just feel like I'm stumbling in the dark.

Anyway sorry about the lack of results, but thanks for all the work this semester.
